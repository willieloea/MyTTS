# MyTTS

## Mission
An app like [ElevenReader](https://elevenreader.io/) allows you to provide it
text, a PDF file, or a link to a webpage, and it will then read the content for
you. Unfortunately, there is a limit to how much one can use this amazing
service for free.

The goal of this project is to enable people to setup their own TTS app.
